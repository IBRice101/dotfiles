# izbr's dotfiles repo

this repository hosues copies of all of my dotfiles on my main daily driver system (Currently Manjaro KDE on my Dell laptop)

In here will be:

* my bash config (not that I use it)
* my emacs config
* my vimrc
* my zshrc
* my tmux config

etc.

## vim

The aim of this vimrc is portability and full featuredness without having to resort to plugins

Note: I have absolutely nothing against plugins, but VIM is so full of stuff that almost anythng you could want is already present in there somewhere, it's just a matter of fining the right settings.
